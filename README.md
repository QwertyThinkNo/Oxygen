# Oxygen

**Version: 1.0.0-alpha1**

A PHP program aimed to alert (distracted) students when their service in the canteen arrives, with a SMS on their smartphones.


This project aims to provide a web interface allowing to indicate the class which must pass to the self / canteen and to send a 
message to the students of the concerned class.

You can retrieve the data of the current passage with the file actualPassage.json in data folder.
